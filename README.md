# UFO

## Analysis Overview

The objective of this project was to create a webpage which integrates several filtering options for a UFO sightings database. 

## Results

While the webpage was initially using a button to refresh the database according to the desired filter criteria, this version allows the database tro refresh after entering criteria in the "Filter Search" element as shown below:

The only step needed to get the database to refresh is to enter the desired filtering parameters in the corresponding box and press the Enter key.

## Summary

### Drawbacks

While this webpage is doing a great job at sorting through data, it is using a pretty old, limited database to do so. The biggest issue with it is probably the small amount of data it is used to filter, and additional entries would have to be manually added in the data file.

### Further development recommendations

This page being a pretty basic project, many things could be done to improve it:

1: The dataset it is using could use a bit of cleanup in order to get all entries to have a similar format in each field. Also, the names of cities, states, and countries are all lower cased and abbreviated, making it difficult for a broader international userbase to determine locations of UFO sightings.

2: Finding a website collecting UFO sightings and refreshing the database used for this page may allow for a lot more entries to be accounted for.

3: While the styling is pretty decent, it could use some additional graphics.

4: Integrating a counter at the bottom of the table would allow users to see how many entries match their filters.
